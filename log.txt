volume vis:
-histogram of data (find min max and then bin)
	   while parsing search min, max
	   set range and num of bins
	   loop over data again and increment bin count
	   print bins
-try other techniques: (mip, iso-surface, compositing)


3/28/2015 Saturday
histogram done
-fix iso surface rendering inaccuracies and noise
-fix speed of rendering
-set color and alpha values to bins
     do step function for now to the bins
     assign arbitrary alpha values
     look into transfer functions proper-pascal 
     function color(density): return color
     function opacity(density): return density
-schemes ( first-iso, average-xray, accumulate-compositing, max intensity )
#-remove background walls (figure out why rendering fails on removing walls)
-add more lights

3/29/2015 Sunday

-work on setting color and alpha values to bins
-work on removing index data structure
 -iterate through the corner locations 
 -figure out neighbors on the fly
 -get the correct bounding indices from corner locations
 -use these indices for gradients, data points

3/30/2015 Monday
-check that old stuff works (works, but took 23 min for threshold of 7k!)
       -git push + new branch
       -begin major refactoring (on the fly calc for binning)
       -old: 20n*float + n * int
       -new: 9n * float + n*int
-try removing index data  structures
