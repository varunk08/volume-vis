volume vis:
-histogram of data (find min max and then bin)
	   while parsing search min, max
	   set range and num of bins
	   loop over data again and increment bin count
	   print bins
-try other techniques: (mip, iso-surface, compositing)


3/28/2015 Saturday
histogram done
-fix iso surface rendering inaccuracies and noise
-fix speed of rendering
-set color and alpha values to bins
     do step function for now to the bins
     assign arbitrary alpha values
     look into transfer functions proper-pascal 
     function color(density): return color
     function opacity(density): return density
-schemes ( first-iso, average-xray, accumulate-compositing, max intensity )
#-remove background walls (figure out why rendering fails on removing walls)
-add more lights

3/29/2015 Sunday
-work on setting color and alpha values to bins
-work on removing index data structure
 -iterate through the corner locations 
 -figure out neighbors on the fly
 -get the correct bounding indices from corner locations
 -use these indices for gradients, data points

3/30/2015 Monday
#-check that old stuff works (works, but took 23 min for threshold of 7k!)
       -git push + new branch (git push -u origin less-mem-attempt)
       -begin major refactoring (on the fly calc for binning)
       -old: 20n*float + n * int
       -new: 9n * float + n*int
#-try removing index data  structures

3/31/2015 Tuesday
8:38 PM - 11:30 PM
#-Fix new stuff (timings are great !!!!! ; mem~705MB; )
-Ask Pascal or Liang about benchmarks for basic volume ray tracer.
-finish volume ray tracer (iso, transfer function)

Post-classification
	- The densities and the gradients are interpolated
	- The color and opacity values are assigned to the sample points based on the transfer function
        - The sample points are shaded based on the interpolated gradients

-Color and alpha function: compositing algorithm

list of positive datasets:
-bonsai
-engine
-teapot

4/6/2015 Tuesday

Create test renderings to show results during meeting.
Fix the foot iso surface rendering;

4/30/2015 Thursday
Haven't worked on this for so long. Haven't worked on anything for so long. What a waste of time.

Next: get transfer functions working.

5/15/2015 Friday
Transfer functions working
Now: reading Legion materials

6/22/2015 Monday
Next: ray tracer in legion
attempted setting up in CADE:
legion OK
ray tracer FAIL
